# Skeleton_Posture-recognition
Gesture and posture recognition

This project is based on a gesture and posture recognition robot interaction system. The main control is divided into two parts. The Jetson Orin Nano is connected to the Obi Zhongguang Gemini2 camera to detect the hand area, obtain the three-dimensional coordinates of the hand, and perform static gesture recognition. The dynamic gesture recognition and robotic arm positioning motion parts are completed by a PC computer. All programs are written in Python, and the camera code is extended based on the Orbbec SDK for Python.
